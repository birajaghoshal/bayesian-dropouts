## Instructions

* (1) explain the theoretical, computational and/or empirical methods, 
* (2) emphasize the main points of the paper, 
* (3) apply it to real data (that you will find). 

Bonus points will be considered if you are creative and add something insightful that is not in the original paper: this can be a theoretical point, an illustrative experiment, etc.

## Format

You can use either Python or R for the programming part. Please have each group send
* one report as a pdf (≤ 15 pages, with reasonable fonts and margins),
* one zipped folder containing your code and a detailed readme file with instructions to (compile/install and) run the code.
